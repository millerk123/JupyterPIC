    "# Single-particle motion workbook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an investigation into single-particle motion within a laser.  Exact, analytical solutions of the particle motion are obtained from J. Yang, R. Craxton, and M. Haines, \"Explicit general solutions to relativistic electron dynamics in plane-wave electromagnetic fields and simulations of ponderomotive acceleration.\" Plasma Phys. Contr. Fusion **53**, 125006 (2011).  This workbook can be used to explore the accuracy of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations when simulating just a single-particle.  Parameters such as the laser intensity as well as initial phase can be varied to obtain different results."

    "Below you can run OSIRIS simulations with your own parameters for the laser amplitude ($A_0$), initial phase deviation from $\\pi/2$ (could be thought of as $\\delta \\phi$, or $\\phi$ in the input deck below), and initial longitudinal proper velocity of the particle ($u_{z0}=\\gamma v_{z0}$).  You will also be able to run with various field solvers and particle pushers.  The laser profile is flat over the middle half of the simulation, then tapers off to zero at the edges.  This is necessary to avoid unphysical results from boundary effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two field solvers available are the Yee and Fei solvers.  The Yee solver is a standard among PIC codes, but has an imperfect dispersion relation for light waves in vacuum.  The Fei solver uses a 16-point stencil in the longitudinal direction to correct for dispersion errors in solving Maxwell's equations as well as for offset electric and magnetic fields in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four particle pushers are Boris (standard), Vay (vay), conditional Vay (cond_vay), and Cary (cary).  The Boris push is standard for PIC codes.  The Vay pusher preserves the $\\vec{E}\\times\\vec{B}$ velocity but is not volume-preserving, and is useful when particles attain very high energies (for large values of $A_0$).  The conditional Vay pusher uses the Boris push for particles with $\\gamma<5$ and the Vay pusher otherwise.  The Cary pusher preserves the $\\vec{E}\\times\\vec{B}$ velocity like the Vay pusher, but it is also volume-preserving, like the Boris push."
