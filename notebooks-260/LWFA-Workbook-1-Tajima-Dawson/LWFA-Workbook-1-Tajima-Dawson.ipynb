    "# LWFA Workbook I:  Tajima and Dawson\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first in a series of workbooks on laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA). This first notebook enables one to reproduce the simulations of T. Tajima and J. M. Dawson, \"Laser Electron Accelerator.\" Phys. Rev. Lett. **43**, 267 (1979) which has now been cited over 4300 times. The notebook will also enable you to experiment with parameters beyond the original paper and prepare you for a follow up notebook (workbook II) that will enable you to study aspects of 1D LWFA including how the wake is excited, how the wake amplitude depends on the laser amplitude and shape, how the electron energy depends on the ratio of the laser and plasma frequency, and how the acceleration length depends on the dephasing of the electron and the wake and on the pump depletion of the laser."

    "In the original work of Tajima and Dawson the laser is intialized inside a plasma (both the electric and magnetic field and the plasma currents based on the linear dispersion relation). The laser pulse shape is rectangular (there are sharp rise and fall times and amplitude is constant over the defined pulse length). The laser is then allowed to propagate through the plasma. For numerical reasons the plasma has a high initial temperature of about 20keV, $kT_e/mc^2=(v_e/c)^2$ where $v_e/c=.2$. It is stated that the simulations \"typically\" use 512 cells with 10 plasma electrons per cell (the ions are a uniform neutralizing background). The cell size is chosen to be $\\Delta=\\lambda_0/15$ where $\\lambda_0$ is the wavelength of the laser inside the plasma. The amplitude of the laser is chosen to be $eE_0/mc\\omega_0=eA_0/mc^2=1$ where $\\omega_0$ is the frequency of the laser assuming the linear dispersion is correct. The duration of the laser was chosen to be $c \\tau_0=\\pi c/\\omega_p$. It is initialized between the $50\\Delta$ and $81.4\\Delta$ and it moves towards higher cell number.  The ratio $\\omega_0/\\omega_p$ can be obtained from the linear dispersion relation $D.R.$ where $c/\\omega_p\\Delta \\equiv \\bar c$ is what Tajima and Dawson call the \"speed of light\" for their simulation code. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is not sufficient detail to know when the simulations used \"typical\" parameters. We have assumed that the cell size was always chosen to be 1/15 of the laser wavelengtgh. We have then done our best to choose the number of cells and simulation length to \"reproduce\" the figures in the paper. However, we do not expect the agreement to be \"perfect\" and we stress that some of the parameters were chosen to to limiations of the simulations that no longer exist today. For example, they used a temperature of 20keV to avoid a numerical instability and they used a code they used a code based on using FFTs so that they always used a cell number that is a muliple of two so they did not have that much flexibility on the number of cells and simulation length.  \n",
